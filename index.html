            Writers write <strong> paragraphs because</strong> their purpose is to describe something. 
            Their point is that something is <em> or disgusting</em> or <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">strangely intriguing.</a> 
            Writers write persuasive and argument paragraphs because their purpose is to persuade or 
            convince someone. Their point is that their reader should see things a particular way and
            possibly take action on that new way of seeing things. <strong>Writers write paragraphs of comparison
            because the comparison will make their point clear to their readers.</strong>

            <em>and lakes have much in common</em> , but they are also quite different. 
            Both are bodies of water, but oceans are very large bodies of salt water, 
            while lakes are much smaller bodies of fresh water. Lakes are usually surrounded by land,
            while oceans are what surround continents. Both have plants and animals living in them. 
            The ocean is home to the largest animals on the planet, whereas lakes support much smaller 
            forms of life. When it is time for a vacation, both will make a great place to visit and enjoy
